# Python Homework- Py Me Up, Charlie
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This challenge encompasses two Python analyses that involve analyzing the financial records of one company and heling a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

## PyBank
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Create a Python script for analyzing the financial records [budget_data.csv](https://github.com/SusanCThomas/PyPoll-PyBank-Python_Challenge/blob/master/PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv) of a company. The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and  `Profit/Losses`.

* Tasked to create a Python script that analyzed the records to calculate each of the following:
    * The total number of months included in the dataset

    * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

    * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* [Output](https://github.com/SusanCThomas/PyPoll-PyBank-Python_Challenge/blob/master/PyBank/analysis/financial.txt) of the analysis is below:

## PyPoll
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Create a Python script to help a small, rural town modernize it's vote counting process [election_data.csv](https://github.com/SusanCThomas/PyPoll-PyBank-Python_Challenge/blob/master/PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv) of a company. The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County` and  `Candidate`.

* Tasked to create a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following:
    * The total number of votes cast

    * A complete list of candidates who received votes

    * The percentage of votes each candidate won

    * The total number of votes each candidate won

    * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* [Output](https://github.com/SusanCThomas/PyPoll-PyBank-Python_Challenge/blob/master/PyPoll/analysis/election_results.txt) of the analysis is below:

### Both scripts should print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
